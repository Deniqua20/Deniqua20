# Hey, I’m Deniqua 👋  
Cloud Security & GRC | Security Operations & Monitoring | Risk, Compliance & Defense

I’m a cybersecurity and network operations professional with hands-on experience monitoring environments, analyzing system and security alerts, and supporting compliance-driven operations in regulated settings. I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at WGU, with a strong focus on cloud security, governance, risk, and compliance.

My work and labs emphasize security monitoring, log analysis, incident documentation, identity and access controls, and data protection using tools such as Microsoft Sentinel, Azure, Splunk, and Wireshark. I take a practical approach by building cloud and security labs, reviewing access configurations, and mapping technical findings to risk, compliance, and operational requirements.

I’m particularly interested in cloud security and GRC roles that bridge technical security operations with risk management, compliance, and policy-driven environments. My goal is to support secure cloud environments, reduce organizational risk, and contribute to teams focused on governance, risk, and compliance.
