# Hey, Iâ€™m Deniqua ðŸ‘‹  
**Aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst | Cloud Security Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner**

Iâ€™m on a mission to protect digital spaces and grow into the cybersecurity analyst I know Iâ€™m meant to be. Currently pursuing my **Cybersecurity & Information Assurance degree at WGU**, Iâ€™m building a strong foundation in **threat detection**, **cloud security**, and **SOC operations**â€”one lab at a time.

From **IT support** to **transportation systems**, Iâ€™ve worked hands-on troubleshooting, managing data, and solving problems. Now, Iâ€™m shifting gears and diving deep into cybersecurity, focused on **incident response**, **risk management**, and **cloud security**.
