# Deniqua üëã  
Aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst | Cloud Security Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner

I‚Äôm a cybersecurity student at WGU, passionate about defending digital environments and continuously growing my skills in cloud security and SOC operations. I‚Äôm hands-on with tools like Splunk and Wireshark, building labs, analyzing logs, and diving into threat detection.

With a background in IT support and transportation systems, I‚Äôve developed a solid foundation in troubleshooting, ticketing systems, and data management. Now, I‚Äôm focused on stepping fully into the cybersecurity world as an analyst, combining my technical skills with a curiosity for threat hunting and risk management.
