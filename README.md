# Hey, Iâ€™m Deniqua ðŸ‘‹  
SOC Analyst | Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Committed to Detection and Defense

Iâ€™m currently earning my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at WGU where Iâ€™m building hands-on experience in threat detection, incident response, and SOC operations. I take a practical approach to learning by building labs, analyzing attack patterns, and working through real-world scenarios found in security operations centers.

Iâ€™m actively developing my skills with tools like Splunk, Wireshark, and TryHackMe while preparing for advanced certifications to deepen my expertise in detection and blue team operations. Each project I complete sharpens my ability to monitor, investigate, and respond to threats in dynamic environments.

My goal is to protect systems, reduce risk, and contribute as a valuable member of a security operations team.
