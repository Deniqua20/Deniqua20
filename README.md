# Deniqua üëã  
Aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst | Cloud Security Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner

I‚Äôm a cybersecurity student at WGU, focused on defending digital environments and growing my skills in threat detection, cloud security, and SOC operations. I‚Äôve gained hands-on experience with tools like Splunk and Wireshark, building labs and practicing log analysis, while continuously sharpening my skills in cybersecurity fundamentals.

With a background in IT support and transportation systems, I bring experience in troubleshooting, ticketing, and data management. I‚Äôm now focused on stepping fully into the cybersecurity world as an analyst, specializing in cloud security, risk management, and incident response.

My studies at WGU have given me a solid foundation in:
- **Network & Systems Security**  
- **Risk Management & Compliance**  
- **Cyber Defense & Incident Response**  
- **Cloud Security & Virtualization**  
- **Security Operations & Monitoring**
