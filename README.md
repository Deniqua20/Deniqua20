# Hey, I’m Deniqua 👋  
IAM & Cloud Security | GRC & Compliance | Security Operations
I’m a cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in network operations, security monitoring, and identity & access management. I hold a Bachelor’s in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance from WGU and 10+ industry certifications including CompTIA Security+, CySA+, PenTest+, and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals.
My work focuses on securing cloud environments through identity governance, access controls, compliance mapping, and security monitoring. I build labs and tools that bridge technical security operations with risk management and policy-driven frameworks — from configuring Azure AD conditional access policies to writing detection queries in Sentinel and Splunk.
I’m pursuing roles in IAM Engineering, Cloud Security, and GRC where I can help organizations reduce risk, enforce least-privilege access, and maintain compliance across cloud environments.
