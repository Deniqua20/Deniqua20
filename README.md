# Hey, Iâ€™m Deniqua ðŸ‘‹  
**Aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst | Cloud Security Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner**

Iâ€™m stepping into my purpose as a cybersecurity analyst, learning, building, and protecting along the way. Iâ€™m currently earning my Cybersecurity and Information Assurance degree at WGU, gaining hands-on skills in threat detection, cloud security, and SOC operations. Every lab I complete brings me closer to where Iâ€™m headed.

Right now, Iâ€™m focused on growing my technical skills and staying active in the cybersecurity space. Iâ€™m building labs, practicing with tools like Splunk and Wireshark, and diving into platforms like TryHackMe to sharpen my threat detection and analysis. Iâ€™m also studying for certifications like CCSP to strengthen my cloud security knowledge and open more doors. Every day Iâ€™m putting in the work to turn this passion into my profession.
